# 5. Conclusion and Discussion:

   - Today's web development require a good page design. A bad design will lead to the lost of visitors which can also lead to the loss of business. In general, an Ebook page has to sastisfy the basic elements of a good page design. This include color contrast, text organization, font selection, style of page, page size, graphics used, and consistency. In order to create a well designed page for audiences, the developer need to organize and analyze the user's statistic and the background of the users. The better the page design, the more hits a page will get, that implies an increase in accessibility and a possible increase in business.

   - Thanks to our lecturer for helping, our team has access to a practical project. As our first approach to the backend, we had obstacles such as lack of knowledge in design features (uploading images, file epub/pdf to database), poor initial database design leading to time consuming and effort to edit. In addition, using github sometimes leads to conflicts that cause system errors. Thanks to that, during the development process, we have drawn our own experiences to improve for the next projects.

## **Pros:**

### 1. WEBSITE WORK WELL:
   From proposed case study, our team has discussed, made a clear requirement and solution for each of features. Therefore leading to easy to implementation, good performance. All core features like download/upload, login/register, search,... are working well. 

### 2. GOOD DESIGN DATABASE:
   Base on relational database, our database is well designed. We use correct data types for each attribute, normalze or denormalize according to context of system design, making good use of views and indexes.

### 3. GOOD FRONT END DESIGN: 
   Due to draft from beginning, design of our website is good looking. In addition, because bootstrap library is used, the responsiveness for smartphone/tablet is effective.
### 4. PAGINATION:
   Except comment in detail book, all other page have pagination

## **Cons:**
### 1. NO FILTER/COOKIES:
   Our website doesn't have filter, lead to potential system security errors. Also we don't have cookies, so every time user access website, they have to login again.

### 2. SOME FUNCTION HAVE NOT DEVELOPED
   Some function like report rating, view other profile, search user,... haven't programmed yet.
### 3. NO CLEAR ARCHITECTURE IN CODING
   Because our team hadn't convention in the beginning, code style of each member in team is different. So our code has no clear architecture, no design pattern, sloppy writing; very hard to read, understand, and develop new features.
